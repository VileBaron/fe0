This project attempts to produce some nice looking Fire Emblem Cipher english cards. Card images and translations are taken from [Serenes Forest FE Cipher Wiki](http://serenesforest.net/wiki/index.php/Fire_Emblem_TCG).

Some tips:
- Install the fonts located in `common/fonts`.
- Translated cards (`.svgz`) should be edited with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) 0.92 or later, and exported as PNG files.
- Printable pages (`.sla.gz`) should be edited with [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/) 1.5.3 or later, and exported as PDF files.
- Some special characters are located in `common/characters.txt`.
- Some common SVG components are saved in `common/components.svgz`. Inkscape has some issues regarding copying & pasting; when not working correctly try reopening the files, or using the _File/Open..._ command from an Inkscape window to avoid starting a new instance of the application.
