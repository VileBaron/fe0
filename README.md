This project attempts to produce some nice looking Fire Emblem Cipher english cards. Card images and translations are taken from [Serenes Forest FE Cipher Wiki](http://serenesforest.net/wiki/index.php/Fire_Emblem_TCG).

Translated cards should be edited with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) 0.92 or later, and exported as PNG files.

Printable pages should be edited with [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/) 1.5.3 or later, and exported as PDF files.
